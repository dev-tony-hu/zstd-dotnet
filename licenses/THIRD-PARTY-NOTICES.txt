Third-Party Notices
====================

Project: zstd-dotnet

This project includes and redistributes third-party components. Their
respective licenses and notices are referenced below.

------------------------------------------------------------
Zstandard (Zstd) Library
------------------------------------------------------------
Language: C
Upstream: https://github.com/facebook/zstd

Usage Scope:
  Only the 'lib' directory source code of Zstandard is compiled into a native
  dynamic library (DLL) which is then invoked via P/Invoke from the managed
  .NET layer of this project.

Architecture Integration:
  Zstd C code (lib) -> Native DLL -> P/Invoke -> .NET wrapper (this package)

License Classification:
  Upstream intentionally separates the library (BSD license) from the
  command-line programs (GPLv2). This project does NOT include, modify or
  distribute any code from the `programs` directory.

Why the BSD license applies:
  The reused portion (lib directory) is under a 3-clause BSD license as stated
  in upstream licensing files. Dynamic linking to a BSD-licensed library does
  not impose copyleft obligations on this project's MIT-licensed managed code.

Obligations:
  - Preserve original BSD copyright and license text (included as
    `licenses/zstdlicense.txt`).
  - Provide attribution in distribution artifacts (this notice file).

No GPLv2 Triggered:
  - No static linking or inclusion of GPL-only program code.
  - Dynamic linking + P/Invoke forms a clear boundary separating managed code.
  - Upstream's separated licensing model (library vs. programs) is respected.

Full License Text:
  See `licenses/zstdlicense.txt` for the complete upstream BSD license.

Summary:
  This project dynamically links only the BSD-licensed library portion of
  Zstandard. No GPLv2 program code is included. Attribution and the original
  BSD license have been preserved; therefore no additional copyleft terms
  apply to this MIT-licensed work.
